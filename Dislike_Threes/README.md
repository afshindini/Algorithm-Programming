# Dislike of Threes
Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by 3 or end with the digit 3 in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.
Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 0) integers which he likes: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,16,…. Output the k-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 1).

Input: The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer k (1≤k≤1000).

Output: For each test case, output in a separate line one integer x which is the k-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.
