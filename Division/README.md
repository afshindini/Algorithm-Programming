# Division
Codeforces separates its users into 4 divisions by their rating:

- For Division 1: 1900≤rating
- For Division 2: 1600≤rating≤1899
- For Division 3: 1400≤rating≤1599
- For Division 4: rating≤1399
Given a rating, print in which division the rating belongs.

Input: The first line of the input contains an integer t (1≤t≤10^4) — the number of testcases.
The description of each test consists of one line containing one integer rating (−5000≤rating≤5000).

Output: For each test case, output a single line containing the correct division in the format "Division X", where X is an integer between 1 and 4 representing the division for the corresponding rating.
