# Plus Or Minus
You are given three integers a, b, and c such that exactly one of these two equations is true:

- a+b=c
- a−b=c

Output + if the first equation is true, and - otherwise.

Input: The description of each test case consists of three integers a, b, c (1≤a,b≤9, −8≤c≤18).

Output: For each test case, output either + or - on a new line, representing the correct equation.
