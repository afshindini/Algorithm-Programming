# Short Sort
There are three cards with letters a, b, c placed in a row in some order. You can do the following operation at most once:
Pick two cards, and swap them. Is it possible that the row becomes abc after the operation? Output "YES" if it is possible, and "NO" otherwise.

Input: The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤6) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single string consisting of each of the three characters a, b, and c exactly once, representing the cards.

Output: For each test case, output "YES" if you can make the row abc with at most one operation, or "NO" otherwise.
