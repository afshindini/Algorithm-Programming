You are given an array a consisting of n (n≥3) positive integers. It is known that in this array, all the numbers except one are the same (for example, in the array [4,11,4,4] all numbers except one are equal to 4).
Print the index of the element that does not equal others. The numbers in the array are numbered from one.

Input: The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100). Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3≤n≤100) — the length of the array a.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤100).
It is guaranteed that all the numbers except one in the a array are the same.

Output: For each test case, output a single integer which is the index of the element that is not equal to others.
