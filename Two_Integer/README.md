# Yet Another Two Integers Problem
You are given two integers a and b.
In one move, you can choose some integer k from 1 to 10 and add it to a or subtract it from a. In other words, you choose an integer k∈[1;10] and perform a:=a+k or a:=a−k. You may use different values of k in different moves.
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a.
You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input: The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤2⋅10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. The only line of the test case contains two integers a and b (1≤a,b≤10^9).

Output: For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a.
