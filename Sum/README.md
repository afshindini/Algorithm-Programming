# Sum
You are given three integers a, b, and c. Determine if one of them is the sum of the other two.

Input: The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤9261) — the number of test cases.
The description of each test case consists of three integers a, b, c (0≤a,b,c≤20).

Ouput: For each test case, output "YES" if one of the numbers is the sum of the other two, and "NO" otherwise.
