# Stair, Peak, or Neither?
You are given three digits a, b, and c. Determine whether they form a stair, a peak, or neither.

- A stair satisfies the condition $a<b<c$.
- A peak satisfies the condition $a<b>c$.

Input: The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains three digits a, b, c (0≤a, b, c≤9).

Output: For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).
