# Nearly Lucky Number
Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.
Unfortunately, not all numbers are lucky. Petya calls a number nearly lucky if the number of lucky digits in it is a lucky number. He wonders whether number n is a nearly lucky number.

Input: The only line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18).

Output: Print on the single line "YES" if n is a nearly lucky number. Otherwise, print "NO".
