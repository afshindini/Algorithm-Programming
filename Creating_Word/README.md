# Creating Word
Matthew is given two strings a and b, both of length 3. He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of a with the first character of b. He wants you to output a and b after the swap.
Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.

Input: The first line contains t (1≤t≤100)  — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, a and b, both of length 3. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

Output: For each test case, after the swap, output a and b, separated by a space.
