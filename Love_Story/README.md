# Love Story
Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string s having length 10 made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string s differs from the string "codeforces".

For example string s= "coolforsez" differs from "codeforces" in 4 indices, shown in bold.
Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string s differs from "codeforces".
Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string s.

Input: The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
Each test case is one line and contains the string s, consisting of exactly 10 lowercase Latin characters.

Output: For each test case, output a single integer — the number of indices where string s differs.
