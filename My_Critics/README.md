# To My Critics
Suneet has three digits a, b, and c.
Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to 10.
Output "YES" if there is such a pair, and "NO" otherwise.

Input: The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains three digits a, b, c (0≤a,b,c≤9).

Output: For each test case, output "YES" if such a pair exists, and "NO" otherwise.
