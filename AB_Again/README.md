Given a two-digit positive integer n, find the sum of its digits.

Input: The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤90) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single two-digit positive integer n (10≤n≤99).

Output: For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the digits of n.
