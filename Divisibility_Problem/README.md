# Divisibility Problem
You are given two positive integers a and b. In one move you can increase a by 1 (replace a with a+1). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b. It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as a is already divisible by b. You have to answer t independent test cases

Input: The first line of the input contains one integer t(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains two integers a and b (1≤a,b≤109).

Output: For each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b.
